# Infinite Monkey Theorem

We all love monkeys üêí  
And so do mathematicians and theory lovers as well.

With this script, you give your desired word, and wait for the monkeys to write your sentence.

## TL;DR About the theory

The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a  
typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any  
given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

```
python main.py
```

## monkey_names.txt

You can give each monkey its own unique name.  
Just write them as shown below:  

```
Mike
Alfonso
Herbert
Yoda
```
If this file is empty, the code asks how many monkeys to create.  
(The default name for a monkey is "Mike")

## Output

| Output        | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Name | Name of the monkey |
| Generated sentence | Sentence generated by the monkey |
| Generated amount | Number of sentences generated |
| Elapsed time | How long it took for the monkey to generate the sentence |
